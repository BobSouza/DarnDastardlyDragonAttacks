DarnDastardlyDragonAttacks
==========================

Little game I put together for an extra credit project. 
v2.0: No changes yet. Stay tuned.

KNOWN ISSUES:  Entering a float as input when integers expected is currently allowed.  Further testing is planned to confirm that this causes problems, but, at the moment, is it assumed that it does.

v1.0:
Text-based castle defense with a moderately complex tax and dragon targeting system.

Some things were implemented a certain way due to the assignment requirements and will be cleaned up in the next few spins of the project.
Some mechanics that were in the initial design did not make it into the first finished spin.  They will be added in pieces.
